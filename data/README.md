# Data

We are sourcing our data set from [a TidyTuesday project](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-05-23/readme.md) on GitHub. Their data originally came from The [2018 Squirrel Census](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw), a project based on the sightings of squirrels in Central Park, New York City.
