# **Investigating Factors into Squirrels\' Attitudes towards Humans in New York**

by BCHZ (Nick Bayer, Richard Cui, Laura Han, Anna Zhang)

## Summary

As a result of the continuous human development, animals are inevitably interacting with humans more often. To better understand the dynamic between squirrels and humans, we used data from The 2018 Squirrel Census, a project based on the sightings of squirrels in Central Park, New York City, to investigate whether the squirrels' attitude towards humans is caused by human presence or other factors such as their species. We compared AIC and BIC to determine the logistic model to fit the data, and we evaluated our model using AUC. While our AUC value is not high, we found some independent variables with a positive coefficient, such as the interaction between kuks and tail flags, which can be used for further research.
